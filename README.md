## Output

The Action will store results in an environment variable that can be used in other steps in a workflow.

Prerequisites:
- GITHUB_TOKEN should have `pull-requests: write` permissions.

Example to create a comment in a PR:
```
- name: Update Pull Request
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  if: ${{ !cancelled() && github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}'
  with:
    script: |
      const output = `
      #### Hadolint: \`${{ steps.hadolint.outcome }}\`
      \`\`\`
      ${process.env.HADOLINT_RESULTS}
      \`\`\`
      `;

      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body: output
      })
```
